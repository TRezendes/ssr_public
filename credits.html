                    First and foremost, I would like to thank <a href="https://rezendes.info" target="_blank">my family</a>. This website only exists because I poured everything I had into it for the better part of two months. Normally I reserve that kind of all-consuming effort for taking care of them. And, of course, I thank them in general; they are my world; they make me who I am from day to day.<br />
                    <br />
                    I also want to thank <a href="https://www.eastern.edu" target ="_blank">Eastern University</a>. First of all, my family wouldn't exist if not for my time there as an undergraduate. More directly related to this project, though, I want to thank the faculty of the Masters of Data Science program. I originally envisioned this website a year ago. I could have envisioned it&mdash;or one like it&mdash;several years ago. The education I received in this program not only made it <em>possible</em> for me to bring that vision to life, it gave me the impetus to actually do it. If you know me, you know that actually <em>doing</em> the thing I mean to do is no mean feat. I am grateful to this degree program for making me do this thing.<br />
                    <br />
                    I want to briefly thank mental health care in general. Around the same time I started my degree program, I also started therapy and ADHD meds. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have finished the former without the latter.<br />
                    <br />
                    Finally, I know I thanked my family already, but I want to give particular thanks to my wife. She is amazing. I love her. She encouraged me to undertake this degree program, and she helped me find the wherewithal to stick with it when I really <em>really</em> wanted to quit. This project is for her in a broad "I-dedicate-this-project-to-my-wife" sort of way, and also in a literal "I-am-building-this-to-be-a-tool-she-can-use-professionally" sort of way. Thank you.
